Learning Journal Entry: Setting Up SkillLink Locally
Date: 21/02/2025
Project: SkillLink – Local Development & Deployment


Getting Started: The Excitement of a Fresh Setup
Setting up the SkillLink application locally was an exciting challenge. From installing XAMPP to configuring the database, each step gave me a better understanding of how different technologies—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL—come together to create a functional web application.
I started with the basics: installing XAMPP and setting up a project folder in the htdocs directory. Once everything was in place, I was eager to see my first page load on http://localhost/3000/. That moment—seeing a simple HTML page displayed—was rewarding!


Challenges Faced & How I Solved Them
Database Connection Errors
One of the initial roadblocks I faced was a database connection error. Every time I tried to register a user, I got the dreaded "Connection failed" message.
 Solution:
•	Checked config.php and realized I forgot to start MySQL in XAMPP.
•	Fixed incorrect database credentials (forgot I named it skilllink_db but was using test_db in the code!).
The moment I saw "Registration successful", I knew I had fixed the issue!


Styling the Dashboard & Sidebar Navigation
The CSS alignment of the dashboard was off—the sidebar was floating awkwardly, and the content wasn’t properly aligned. It took some trial and error to position everything correctly.
 Solution:
•	Used CSS Flexbox to align the sidebar neatly on the left.
•	Adjusted the margin-left of the main content to prevent it from overlapping.
•	Tweaked the user profile section so that the image and text aligned well.
It was satisfying to see the final design come together in a clean, structured layout!


Handling File Uploads for Profile Pictures
Allowing users to upload profile images was another challenge. Initially, the images weren’t saving correctly. Either they weren’t uploading, or they weren’t displaying after upload.
 Solution:
•	Checked file permissions on the uploads/ folder.
•	Ensured the image file type was being validated properly.
•	Used move_uploaded_file() to correctly store the images in the designated folder.
After these fixes, I successfully uploaded a profile picture, refreshed the dashboard, and—boom!—there it was, neatly displayed beside my user details.


Biggest Takeaways & Lessons Learned
Debugging is part of the journey – Every issue is a chance to learn and improve problem-solving skills.
 A well-structured project folder makes life easier – Organizing files logically saved me so much time.
 Testing regularly is key – Every time I implemented a new feature, I tested it immediately, catching issues early.


Next Steps & Improvements
Deploy SkillLink online – Move the project from localhost to a live server.
Enhance the UI – Add smooth transitions and animations for a better user experience.
 Improve security – Implement password reset, email verification, and better session handling.
Setting up SkillLink was a fulfilling experience, filled with both struggles and victories. The feeling of fixing a bug after hours of debugging is priceless! Looking forward to deploying the project and seeing it go live. 


Reflection:
 "Every challenge faced during development is an opportunity to grow. Coding is all about patience, persistence, and passion!"
