Learning Journal Entry: Creating an Astra Child Theme
Date: 1st March 2025
Project: Astra Child Theme Development

Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I focused on creating and customizing an Astra-Child theme for WordPress. I followed various tutorials and referred to documentation to understand how child themes work and how to modify them without affecting the parent theme.

Resources Used:

Astra theme documentation: Astra Child Theme https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/
YouTube tutorial on child themes: YouTube Link https://youtu.be/y6Shl6tS5zE?si=qMAIdL311uZC8fWy
LinkedIn Learning course on WordPress customization: LinkedIn Learning https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-building-child-themes-3


Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 5 hours this week on learning and customizing the Astra-Child theme.

Content Insights
I learned that a child theme allows me to modify the appearance and functionality of a WordPress site without altering the original files of the parent theme. This makes it easier to update the parent theme without losing customizations.
Astra-Child theme uses a style.css file for custom styles and a functions.php file to enqueue scripts and styles from the parent theme.
I discovered that overriding template files in a child theme involves creating files with the same name and structure as those in the parent theme.
Understanding the use of hooks and filters in Astra was a bit challenging initially, but after exploring the documentation, I got a better grasp of how to use them for customizing header, footer, and sidebar elements effectively.


Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Developing a child theme helped me understand the importance of separating core functionality (in the parent theme) from customizations (in the child theme). This practice seems valuable in a professional setting, where maintaining and updating websites without disrupting user experience is critical.
I realized that learning to use hooks and filters efficiently is a valuable skill for a WordPress developer, as it allows for more controlled and modular customization.
Through this week's learning, I understood the significance of project documentation and version control (using GitHub). Keeping track of changes through a GitHub repo not only organizes the development process but also prepares me for real-world projects where collaboration and version control are essential.
Moving forward, I plan to deepen my understanding of PHP functions used in WordPress and explore more advanced customization techniques to enhance my employability in web development.


Reflection: Building the Astra child theme was a great hands-on learning experience. It helped me understand the importance of maintaining a clean and update-safe customization approach in WordPress. Looking forward to diving deeper into theme development!
