Introduction
The first week of our team project focused on setting up essential collaboration and workflow tools. This step was crucial to ensuring seamless communication, task management, and version control throughout the project. The primary objective was to create and organize links for platforms that would enhance our teamwork and efficiency.

Tasks Completed
During this week, we created and set up links for the following platforms:

GitHub Repository

A dedicated GitHub Classroom link was created for the project:
GitHub Classroom Link : https://classroom.github.com/a/6bHRbpaJ
This repository will serve as the central codebase for our project, where all team members can contribute, review, and track code changes.
Slack Workspace

We set up a Slack channel for communication:

This channel will be used for quick discussions, announcements, and sharing updates among team members.
Trello Board for Task Management

A Trello board was created to organize project tasks and track progress:

Reflections and Learnings
This first week highlighted the importance of proper setup and organization in a team project. Establishing these links early has laid a strong foundation for effective collaboration. I have also learned more about integrating different tools for better project management.

Next Steps
In the coming weeks, we will focus on defining project requirements, assigning tasks, and beginning the initial stages of development. The collaboration tools set up this week will play a crucial role in keeping us organized and aligned.
