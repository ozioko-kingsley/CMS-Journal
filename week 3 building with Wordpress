SkillLink WordPress Development Journal

Learning Activities & Resources

This week, I worked on setting up the WordPress site for SkillLink using a minimal approach, avoiding page builders and relying on core WordPress functionality with only essential plugins. The primary focus was on structuring the site, implementing a call-to-action (CTA) button, and ensuring smooth navigation for users.

Resources explored:
- WordPress Theme Development Guide: [https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/)
- WordPress Plugin Handbook: [https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/)
- YouTube tutorials on creating a CTA button without page builders: [https://youtu.be/example](https://youtu.be/example)

Plugins used:
- Contact Form 7 (for form submissions)
- Yoast SEO (for optimization)
- WP Super Cache (for speed improvements)


Estimated Hours
- Research and learning: 3 hours
- Implementation and testing: 5 hours
- Debugging and refinement: 2 hours
- Total: 10 hours



Content Insights

1. AI-Powered Career Recommendations 
   - The AI recommendation system required structured content within WordPress to be properly indexed.
   - Using a custom template allowed for better integration of AI-driven insights without relying on third-party page builders.
   - Shortcodes and custom fields in WordPress made it easier to display dynamic career suggestions based on user input.

2. Personalized Learning Paths 

   - WordPress’s built-in categories and tags were used to organize learning resources, ensuring better content discoverability.
   - The LearnPress plugin was considered but ultimately avoided to keep the setup lightweight.
   - Custom post types helped create structured educational materials while maintaining flexibility for future updates.

3. Mentor Connections for Career Growth  
 
   - A simple registration form was created using Contact Form 7 to connect students with mentors.
   - The form submissions were stored in the database, and a manual matchmaking process was established.
   - Future plans include using a lightweight membership plugin to facilitate direct mentor-mentee interactions.


Career/Employability/Learning Insights

- Avoiding page builders encouraged a deeper understanding of WordPress’s core functionality, making the site more lightweight and optimized.
- Custom themes provided greater control over design and performance compared to pre-built themes.
- Debugging issues related to WordPress’s PHP functions improved my problem-solving skills and reinforced my understanding of backend development.
- Managing plugins effectively ensured the site remained fast and secure without unnecessary bloat.
- Learning through trial and error (implementing, testing, and refining) was more effective than simply watching tutorials.

Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of balancing simplicity with functionality in WordPress development. The result can be viewed here: https://kingsleyskilllink.infinityfreeapp.com/
