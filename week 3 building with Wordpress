SkillLink WordPress Development Journal

Learning Activities & Resources

This week, I worked on setting up the WordPress site for SkillLink using a minimal approach, avoiding page builders and relying on core WordPress functionality with only essential plugins. The primary focus was on structuring the site, implementing a call-to-action (CTA) button, and ensuring smooth navigation for users.

Resources explored:
- WordPress Theme Development Guide: [https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/)
- WordPress Plugin Handbook: [https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/)
- YouTube tutorials on creating a CTA button without page builders: [https://youtu.be/example](https://youtu.be/example)

Plugins used:
- Contact Form 7 (for form submissions)
- Yoast SEO (for optimization)
- WP Super Cache (for speed improvements)


Estimated Hours
- Research and learning: 3 hours
- Implementation and testing: 5 hours
- Debugging and refinement: 2 hours
- Total: 10 hours



Content Insights

1. AI-Powered Career Recommendations 
   - The AI recommendation system required structured content within WordPress to be properly indexed.
   - Using a custom template allowed for better integration of AI-driven insights without relying on third-party page builders.
   - Shortcodes and custom fields in WordPress made it easier to display dynamic career suggestions based on user input.

2. Personalized Learning Paths 

   - WordPress’s built-in categories and tags were used to organize learning resources, ensuring better content discoverability.
   - The LearnPress plugin was considered but ultimately avoided to keep the setup lightweight.
   - Custom post types helped create structured educational materials while maintaining flexibility for future updates.

3. Mentor Connections for Career Growth  
 
   - A simple registration form was created using Contact Form 7 to connect students with mentors.
   - The form submissions were stored in the database, and a manual matchmaking process was established.
   - Future plans include using a lightweight membership plugin to facilitate direct mentor-mentee interactions.


Career/Employability/Learning Insights

- Avoiding page builders encouraged a deeper understanding of WordPress’s core functionality, making the site more lightweight and optimized.
- Custom themes provided greater control over design and performance compared to pre-built themes.
- Debugging issues related to WordPress’s PHP functions improved my problem-solving skills and reinforced my understanding of backend development.
- Managing plugins effectively ensured the site remained fast and secure without unnecessary bloat.
- Learning through trial and error (implementing, testing, and refining) was more effective than simply watching tutorials.


Group formation and interview insights

Context:
The main purpose of our project group formation was to enhance our chances of making an informed and effective decision. We formed a group of three individuals: Kingsley, Depeesh, and Lean. The aim was to establish a collaborative and functional team that could effectively work together on the project. During the group formation interview, we focused on discussing important aspects such as our availability, individual skills, prior experiences, and conflict management strategies.

Key Insights:
Availability and Commitment:

We discussed our individual schedules to ensure that we could commit to the project timeline. This helped in understanding each other's availability, which was crucial in setting expectations for the project.
Skills and Experience:

Each member shared their unique skills and previous experiences relevant to the project. This allowed us to identify strengths within the group, such as Kingsley’s proficiency in research, Depeesh’s expertise in technical aspects, and Lean’s creative problem-solving skills.
Conflict Management:

One of the key topics discussed was conflict management. We all agreed on the importance of having open communication and a calm approach when addressing disagreements or challenges. We recognized that having a clear strategy for conflict resolution would be vital for maintaining a productive working environment.
Strengths and Weaknesses:

Through the interview, we gained a better understanding of each other’s strengths and weaknesses. We were able to identify areas where we could support one another, such as Lean offering to assist Depeesh with brainstorming ideas, and Kingsley helping Lean with organizational tasks.
Leadership Decision:

We did not rush into choosing a group leader. Depeesh suggested we take our time to identify someone who best fits the leadership role as the project progresses. This idea emphasized the importance of situational leadership, where the leader may emerge based on the group’s evolving needs.

Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of balancing simplicity with functionality in WordPress development. The result can be viewed here: https://kingsleyskilllink.infinityfreeapp.com/
