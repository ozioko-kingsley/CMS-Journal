Learning Activities & Resources

This week, I focused on developing a Skilllink website using Joomla, hosted on InfinityFree. I began by installing Joomla through InfinityFree's control panel, utilizing the Softaculous Apps Installer for a streamlined setup. To understand the default template configurations, I consulted the Joomla documentation, which provided insights into managing and customizing templates. Additionally, I reviewed the CP3402 Assignment Breakdown to ensure alignment with the project requirements.

Estimated Hours

I dedicated approximately 5 hours this week to these activities, excluding the time spent on actual website development.

Content Insights

Through this process, I learned that Joomla's default templates offer a solid foundation for website development, with customizable options to tailor the site to specific needs. The InfinityFree hosting platform, while free, presents certain limitations, such as restricted access to server configurations, which can impact the implementation of advanced features. The CP3402 Assignment Breakdown emphasized the importance of adhering to project specifications and provided a clear framework for the development process.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Engaging with Joomla and navigating the constraints of free hosting services like InfinityFree has enhanced my problem-solving skills and adaptability in web development. Understanding how to work within hosting limitations while still delivering a functional and aesthetically pleasing website is a valuable skill in the industry. The experience underscored the importance of thorough planning and resourcefulness, especially when working with limited resources. 

Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of balancing simplicity with functionality in Joomla development. The result can be viewed here: https://week2prac.great-site.net/
