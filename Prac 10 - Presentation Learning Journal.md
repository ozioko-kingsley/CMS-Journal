## üìò GitHub Learning Journal Entry  
**Project**: Baizonn Learning Center Website  
**Feature**: Testimonial Page  
**Contributor**: Kingsley Ozioko

###  **What I Worked On**
This week, I focused on developing the **Testimonial Page** for the Baizonn Learning Center website. The goal was to showcase real success stories from parents and students to build trust and encourage new enrollments.

The testimonials were sourced from our client document and needed to be:
- Cleanly formatted  
- Visually engaging  
- Responsive across devices



### **Key Learning & Implementation**
- I **structured the page using HTML5 semantic tags** for accessibility and SEO (e.g., `<section>`, `<blockquote>`, `<cite>`).
- Used **modular SCSS styling** to maintain consistency in spacing, contrast, and layout.
- Built a **responsive carousel** to display testimonials one at a time, enhancing user interaction and focus.
- Used **CSS Flexbox and media queries** to ensure responsiveness across screen sizes.
- Added **navigation arrows** and **smooth sliding transitions** for a polished user experience.



###  **Tools & Technologies**
- WordPress (custom theme development)  
- SCSS (compiled via Gulp)  
- GitHub for version control  
- Trello for tracking testimonial task card  
- Visual Studio Code as my IDE  



###  **Challenges I Faced**
One challenge was making the carousel look balanced across screen sizes, especially with varied testimonial lengths. I resolved this by:
- Ensuring **consistent height containers** using Flexbox alignment  
- Applying **typographic scale and spacing rules** for legibility  
- Using a **carousel library** or custom JS/CSS logic for slide transitions

Testing responsiveness with **Chrome DevTools** and adjusting breakpoints manually ensured the layout worked well on both desktop and mobile.



### **Outcome**
The final Testimonial Page features:
- A **carousel layout** with smooth navigation between testimonials  
- Each testimonial clearly attributed (e.g., ‚Äú‚Äì Sarah K., Export Manager‚Äù)  
- A clean, brand-aligned design consistent with the rest of the site  
- Fully responsive behavior with minimalistic styling and lightweight performance


### **Reflection**
This task reinforced the importance of **user experience and content delivery** in trust-building pages like testimonials. I gained confidence in implementing **carousel UI components**, fine-tuning **responsive designs**, and ensuring content stays accessible and visually appealing across devices.

Excited to apply these improvements to other content-driven components such as **FAQs**, **Course Reviews**, or even **Student Highlights**!
