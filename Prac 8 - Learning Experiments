LEARNING EXPERIMENT: Evaluating Content Management Systems (CMS) vs. Manual Web Development

INTRODUCTION
In modern web development, choosing between a Content Management System (CMS) and manual coding is crucial.
•	CMS platforms like WordPress and Joomla offer pre-built tools, making website development faster and more accessible.
•	Manual coding involves writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch, offering full control but requiring advanced technical skills.
This experiment evaluates the efficiency of CMS and manual coding in terms of speed, ease of use, customization, security, and content management. The results will help businesses, developers, and beginners determine the best approach for their web projects.

HYPOTHESIS
Using a CMS like WordPress or Joomla will lead to:
1.	Faster website development.
2.	Easier content updates.
3.	Improved efficiency compared to manual coding.
This is based on the assumption that CMS platforms provide user-friendly tools, pre-built templates, and plugin integrations, reducing development time and technical complexity. In contrast, manual coding requires building everything from scratch, making it time-intensive.

|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SEO                        | WordPress has Yoast SEO; Joomla has built-in SEO. | Manual optimization required.                                              |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Content Management         | Easy content updates via editor.                  | Requires manual content management.                                        |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| E-Commerce                 | WooCommerce (WordPress), VirtueMart (Joomla).     | Custom solutions take longer but allow full control.                       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Community & Support        | Large support community & documentation.          | No built-in support; relies on developer knowledge.                        |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cost                       | Lower cost due to free CMS & plugins.             | Higher cost for development & maintenance.                                 |
| Scalability                | Suitable for small-medium sites; enterprise       | Ideal for large-scale apps with full performance control.                  |
|                            | scaling needs extra setup.                        |                                                                            |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Conclusion:
•	CMS (WordPress & Joomla) is ideal for beginners, small businesses, and non-technical users who want to quickly build and manage a website.
•	Manual Coding is best for developers who need full control, custom functionalities, and high-performance applications.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS
1.	WordPress enables faster deployment due to its intuitive interface and extensive third-party plugin ecosystem.
2.	Joomla offers more structured content management, making it suitable for complex sites like forums and portals.
3.	CMS platforms significantly reduce development time compared to manual coding, especially for feature-rich websites.
4.	Manual coding provides greater control over performance and security, but at the cost of increased development time and complexity.

METHODOLOGY
1. Manual Coding Approach
•	Build a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
•	Design navigation, structure, and a contact form without pre-built tools.
•	Record development time and note challenges.
•	Test ease of updating content by making modifications.
2. CMS Approach (WordPress)
•	Develop a similar website using WordPress.
•	Utilize themes and plugins (e.g., WPForms for the contact form).
•	Record development time and evaluate ease of customization.
•	Test content updates through the WordPress dashboard.

2.	Manual coding allows for more control and customization but is time-intensive and requires debugging.
3.	CMS platforms simplify content updates without requiring coding skills.
4.	Security concerns differ: CMS may introduce vulnerabilities through plugins, whereas manual coding requires implementing security from scratch.

CONCLUSION & LEARNING INSIGHTS
Conclusion
This experiment confirms that CMS platforms like WordPress are highly efficient for website development, particularly for quick deployment and content management. This aligns with industry trends favouring CMS tools for businesses and non-technical users. However, manual coding remains essential for full customization, performance optimization, and unique design requirements.

Final Reflection
Through this experiment, I gained deeper insights into both approaches:
•	CMS tools enhance productivity and accessibility, making them ideal for non-technical users.
•	Manual coding provides unmatched control, which is essential for complex projects.
•	For future projects, a hybrid approach may be optimal—using CMS for standard content management while leveraging custom coding for unique functionalities.

POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
•	Testing Other CMS Platforms: Explore how Joomla, Drupal, or Shopify compare to WordPress.
•	SEO and Performance Analysis: Evaluate CMS-built websites in terms of speed and search engine ranking.
•	Security Aspects: Conduct security audits to assess vulnerabilities in CMS vs. manual coding.
